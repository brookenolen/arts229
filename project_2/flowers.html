        <article class="box article"><h2>Flower of the Week</h2><h3>Red Piano Garden Rose</h3>
          <h3>A showstopper all on its own! The red piano garden rose is dark red around the edges, and lighter in the middle.
          Although it could be paired with any flower or green, it is easily stunning all alone.
        This particular garden rose lasts long, and has a subtle fragrance. It is available all year round, and
      when working with red piano it is best to leave out in room temperature. The rose looks spectacular after it has opened.</h3>
