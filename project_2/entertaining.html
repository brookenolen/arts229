<h3>Weddings, banquets, conferences, birthday parties, whatever you are planning, can seem like a huge hassle.
Unless you are a professional planner, you may be feeling overwhelmed. Believe it or not, planning an event
can be simple; just as long as you know how to find the right resources. Here are a few quick tips to get started:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are looking for flowers, shop local and stick with simple.
  A single flower with a couple sprigs of greenery will look stunning next to a candle or two.</li>
  <li>When shopping for tablecloths to match your theme, check out the craft store. Buy a couple yards of a soft fabric,
  spread it lengthwise down the table, and then scrunch, narrowing it to the center. You'll have an effortless, rustic and elegant look.</li>
  <li>Want plates to coordinate? Don't buy anything expensive, rather shop at the dollar store or somewhere similar.
  You'll find an assortment of matching plates, and your guests won't think twice!</li>
  <li>Lastly, have fun with it! The more you spend thinking and losing sleep over your event,
  the more stressfull you'll be. Instead, just go with the flow! Afterall, it's all about gathering with friends and family!</li>
</ul>
