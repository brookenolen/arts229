<div class="box B2"><h3>Brooke Nolen, of Brooke MaryLee Designs,
  BLEW ME AWAY with her floral work for our wedding.
  She did two beautiful bouquets for me and my maid-of-honor,
  and also decorated the outdoor arbor that my husband and I got married under.
  I had a vision for what I wanted the arbor to look like,
  and Brooke BEYOND exceeded our expectations!!!
  I was literally in awe of the beauty and intricacy of the arbor.
  THANK YOU, Brooke MaryLee Designs! -Heather</h3>
