          <h3>Brooke is a floral designer in Michigan. She has been working as a florist
          in the Lansing area for two and a half years. She started at the local farmer's market
        learning all the skills and techniques it takes to be competitive in the floral industry.
      Recently, Brooke started her own business taking on floral projects of all sizes. In her first
    wedding season she scheduled seventeen successful weddings. Brooke says her favorite part of
  creating floral arrangements is meeting new people and making connections. She thrives on pinpointing
her clients' interests and making their dreams a reality.</h3></article>
